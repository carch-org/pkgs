> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing or uploading packages that act as installer scripts or customize the system in a way that diverges from the official guidelines is not allowed on the AUR.

>  As such, the package has been removed from the AUR. I respect the AUR guidelines, and I encourage you to check the main Carch project for alternative installation methods. Thank you!

> [!NOTE]
> Carch is not available on the AUR because it is a script. However, you can use the provided package build to run Carch as a package, similar to an AUR package, or visit the Carch documentation for the CLI installer. Thank you!
